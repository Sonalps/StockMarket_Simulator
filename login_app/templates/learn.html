    <p>A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company and constitutes a claim on part of the company's assets and earnings.
        <br>
        While the stock market is a collection of markets and exchanges where the buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly held companies take place.
        <br>
        <br>
        How the Stock Market Works
        <br>
        Initial Public Offering (IPO): When a company decides to go public, it issues shares through an IPO. This allows the company to raise capital from public investors.
        <br>
        Trading: Investors can buy and sell stocks through exchanges or OTC markets. This is facilitated by brokers who act as intermediaries.
        <br>
        Prices: Stock prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, influenced by factors like company performance, economic data, and market sentiment.
        <br>
        Indexes: Stock market indexes, like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, track the performance of a group of stocks to give an overall view of the market's health.
